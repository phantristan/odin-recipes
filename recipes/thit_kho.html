        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>"Thit Kho" is a vietnamese dish that involves carmelized pork belly. This dish is very
            popular in Vietnamese households for everyday eating but is also traditionally served 
            during Tet, the Vietnamese Lunar New Year. The longer you cook the pork belly, the 
            more tender it becomes.

        <h5>Ingredients</h5>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds pork belly, trimmed</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons white sugar</li>
            <li>5 shallots, sliced</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
            <li>ground black pepper to taste</li>
            <li>13 fluid ounces coconut water</li>
            <li>6 hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Steps</h5>
        <ol>
            <li>Slice the pork belly into 1-inch pieces layered with skin, fat, and meat</li>
            <li>Heat sugar in a large wok or pot over medium heat until it melts and 
                carmelizes into a light brown syrup, about 5 minutes. Add pork and increase
                heat to high. Cook and stir to render some of the pork fat, 3 to 5 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Stir shallots and garlic into the wok. Add fish sauce and black pepper; stir 
                to evenly coat pork. Pour in coconut water and bring to a boil. Add eggs,
                reduce heat to low, and simmer, covered, until pork is tender, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>Remove wok from the heat and let stand, about 10 minutes. Skim the fat from
                the surface of the dish
            </li>
        </ol>
